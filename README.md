# image-labelling-bot
A Telegram Bot helping you sort your images

Google Cloud Function that connects to Google Cloud Vision AI in order to classify the images you forward to the Telegram bot.
The detected classes will be sent back as hashtags so you can use the Telegram search in order to find images by category.

Simple side-project I did for fun in an hour or two. Not online anymore to prevent high bills. If you want to host it, check out the Google Cloud Build configuration file, `cloudbuild.yaml`.
